### P0

Agent needs to be communciated with through message input
Agent needs to be able to call MCP tools
Aghent needs to be abel to call MCP tools without being specifically prompted to
User shoudl be be able to directly call MCP tools without having to go through the agent

### P1
** creattre gherkin for all of them **

- make it so theres a few "keywords and phrases" that will map to specific tide-tools and they can be direclty called and executed

- Use hierarchal tide context rather than manual switching - user enters a flow, the flow cascades from daily to weekly and then monthly. users when they get insights, autocamtically considers flows from the time frames time context they are in

- you can only have one flow at once, you need to close your last flow to start another. you xan retroactively close th elast flow

- When you open the app, you are talking about your day. Evertythign automatically logs

- you speak to the agent automatically, no need to call the agent

- agent uses workers ai to speak conversationally

- if you want to try a tool, just ype it in and it will appear above, which you can select and have it autofill. you can also slash command for the lsit fo them to appear. think abotu slashing vs jsut goign to ffor the autocorrect

- whena. user selects a flow from the tide tools list, it eitehr fires autocamttically or it is added to the message and then they are to compelte it, idk yet


## p2

explore proejct-based flows


### P3

make the gap the list scrolls up from a gradient
add dividers between each setion on the list
tighten up th spacing
make important ones bigger (three on top)

tid emanagement options should appear when you clickt he top menu, not as a tool
start a flow should be an ephereal option, it shoudl always show the ongoign flow and an option to create a new one, or an exsiting flow
review wher ethe rest of the options should go.
