## What we do here

We request an analysis about a tide (might happen automatically) and then we can start adding information (through prompts) to the tide, and then we can end or update certain flows that occurred at some point. 

Each "context window" is kind of a "conversation" or a "flow" that you have with the app. This is where users can also create a new tide in the top right header, which leads them to the tides screen. Above the prompt area is a scrolling list of tags that say "daily, weekly, project, or monthly".
