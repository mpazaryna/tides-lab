# What is Tides?

Tides tracks your energy and focus patterns to improve your workflows. Built by engineers who recognized that their productivity mirrors the natural rythym of the ocean - periods of high energy flows followed by waning ebbs

Tides is the result of two engineers who love the ocean and strive for self-actualization. Both realized that our daily energy, focus, and workflows mirror the natural rhythms of the ocean's tides and swells, and have improved their focus and workflows based on treating their they discovered adopting this mindset. Tides app allows us to share these techniques and make it easy to learn the same way we learned.

## What we beleive

The interaction of tides and swells from the mother ocean mirror how each other's energy and focus can wax and wane throughout the day like the natural rhythm of tides and flows of the ocean.

## How Tides Works

Spend some time with Tides, speak to it in conversational interfaces with guided buttons and directions so you don't feel lost and so everything is easy to understand - and help Tides track your natural rhythms, the ebbs and flows of your personal energy and focus so you can determine how to work better and longer.

Tides aims to be ambient tracking through natural conversation rather than forms. We both use Tides as a part of our actual workflow to track our thinking process.

Experiment and play with the relationship between your natural rhythms and ebbs of energy and focus throughout your day and make your own inferences and decisions based on what has worked for both of us, train your brain on a visualization, thinking, and self-actualization tool.

## Why Not Other Mood Trackers?

Mood tracking is great and has been tried with a bunch of apps, spreadsheets, notes etc. We saw the benefit clearly. In reality the cognitive load to keep it up is that kind of interface is unsustainable - at least in my experience.

Tides works together and serves as a useful partner that keeps you coming back because it has utilitarian real-time purpose that provides you with real-time recommendations related to your energy and focus rather than general use AI patterns. While designed for work, we've found Tides has crept into our own lives as well.

## What Makes Tides Special

What is new and special about Tides is using a remote intermittent MCP connection that, like how cars will now shut themselves off at red lights when not being used, Tides AI agents establish a connection with remote MCP servers that give Tides focused, organized, and lightweight connections with libraries and databases.

Tides itself is a workflow tracking app, similar to a mood tracking app. The conversational interface and most useful, fast, organized, and relevant AI system built to scale to date from a mobile application - so you can interact with it anywhere you bring your phone.

#  When You Use Tides

## Getting Started

When you open the app you'll see your existing tides, choose to keep them going or wind them down - and retroactively say when they wound down in case you forgot to go to your app before.

Spend some time with Tides before you sit down for work and chat with it like your interface, set goals for yourself, and refocus. End any tides from yesterday, tell it more about what you got done.

We make it easy to interact with old tides.

## App Structure



### Tides and Flows



## Experience Design

When a user enters the app, they see on top a list of all their active tides.

Within each tide, they can click on it and itnteract with it like add info, modify it, or stop it

Each tide has "flows" - it always refers to the times you sit down and focus as "flows".

Each tide is daily, weekly, longer, or even project based depending on your workflow. These are the tides we track and we want to make each of these tides as good as possible.

You should be able to see when each tide started, where each tide ended, and where we are in each tide. An example of "Where we are" includes the energy arc, the time, and patterns, insights, current state, and recommendations.

You talk within each tide and it will give you insights, recommendations and more. Tides AI is the expert on how this flow should be treated throughout your life.

A context window is a "flow" - this context window must stay open when you leave and reopen the app.

So we need a home screen which is basically messages, then we need a tides screen which is a conversation but the conversation isn't important, it's the recommendations and insights we get from the tides.

Button for adding energy level (check-in), share a message about the tide, and then submit. From there you can also request an evaluation where you get insights. This evaluation is derived from everything you've shared about tides.

Within each tide is a "flow".
