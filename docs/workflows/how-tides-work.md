woudl it be difficult to have all daily tides immediatel;y considered by weekly tides, and then all daily and weekly tides be considered by monthly tides?

I should enter the app and start journalling and creating flows, that flow should go into my daily context, my weekly   context, and my monthly context. I shouldnt need to switch into a monthly tide and then start a monthly flow.    

If i start a flow, that flow dta is put into my daily, weekly, and monthly tide. then i should be able to toggle between my daily context, my weekly context, and my monthly context and ask mthe tides agent to list all my flows, create insights, etc.

Is this feasible?
