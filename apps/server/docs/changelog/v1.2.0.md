# v1.2.0 - 2025-08-05

This release focuses on improved test organization and tool architecture refactoring for better maintainability and scalability.

## Enhanced

- **Test organization**: Reorganized tests into unit/, integration/, and e2e/ folders for better maintainability
- **Tools architecture**: Refactored monolithic tides.ts (857 lines) into domain-specific modules:
  - `tide-core.ts` - Core tide creation and listing operations
  - `tide-sessions.ts` - Flow sessions and energy tracking
  - `tide-tasks.ts` - External task integration (GitHub/Linear)
  - `tide-analytics.ts` - Reporting and participant management
  - `index.ts` - Unified exports maintaining backward compatibility

## Fixed

- **Auth test reliability**: Updated authentication tests to match current API key implementation
- **HTTP status code validation**: Fixed auth-check.test.ts to accept proper status codes (401, 406)
- **Import path consistency**: Updated all test imports after directory restructuring
- **Package.json cleanup**: Removed obsolete KV namespace commands after D1/R2 migration

## Removed

- **Legacy files**: Removed empty test.json, obsolete Python reference code (36 files), and duplicate database files
- **Consolidated database schema**: Combined migration-001 and schema.sql into unified schema.sql

## Infrastructure

- **Database optimization**: Single unified schema.sql with all tables, indexes, and test data
- **File organization**: Moved benchmark scripts to appropriate `scripts/benchmark/` location
- **Documentation updates**: Enhanced README with current architecture and testing commands

## Breaking Changes

- Import paths updated for refactored tool modules
- Test file locations changed due to reorganization

## Migration Guide

If extending existing tests, update import paths:
- Old: `import { function } from '../src/tools/tides'`
- New: `import { function } from '../src/tools'` (uses new index exports)
