# v1.3.0 - 2025-08-06

This release introduces a complete autonomous agent system built on Cloudflare Durable Objects, providing real-time features and WebSocket support for React Native applications.

## Added

- **Cloudflare Agents Implementation**: Complete autonomous agent system built on Durable Objects
  - `HelloAgent` - Production-ready agent with REST API and WebSocket support
  - Agent routing system supporting multiple agents (`/agents/{name}/*` pattern)
  - State persistence using Durable Object storage with SQLite backend
  - Real-time WebSocket communication (ping/pong, echo, broadcast, stats)
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 
  - Unit tests: 15/15 passing for HelloAgent functionality
  - Integration tests: 9/9 passing for agent routing logic
  - End-to-end tests: 17/17 passing (14 REST + 3 WebSocket)
  - Automated E2E test scripts for all environments
- **Agent Infrastructure**:
  - Multi-agent architecture ready for `TideAgent`, `AnalyticsAgent`, etc.
  - WebSocket support for React Native real-time features
  - Agent metrics and logging integration
  - Production deployment to `tides-001.mpazbot.workers.dev`

## Enhanced

- **Development Workflow**: Complete test-driven development approach
  - Mock Durable Object state for unit testing
  - WebSocket testing with Node.js `ws` package
  - Bash-based E2E test suite with environment support
  - Real-time log monitoring via `wrangler tail`
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive agent system documentation
  - Agent patterns and architecture guidelines
  - Testing strategies and examples
  - Deployment and monitoring instructions
  - WebSocket integration patterns for mobile apps

## Technical Implementation

- **Agent Structure**:
  - `agents/hello/hello-agent.ts` - HelloAgent Durable Object class
  - `tests/agents/hello.test.ts` - Complete unit test suite
  - `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end testing infrastructure
  - Agent routing in `src/index.ts` with path rewriting
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Visit counting with persistence
  - Message storage and retrieval
  - Agent statistics and health monitoring
  - State reset functionality
  - WebSocket real-time communication
  - Error handling (400, 404, 500 status codes)
- **Deployment Configuration**:
  - Durable Object bindings in `wrangler.toml`
  - SQLite storage for free tier compatibility
  - Environment-specific agent deployment
  - TypeScript type generation with `wrangler types`

## Infrastructure

- **Production Ready**: Fully deployed and tested on Cloudflare Workers edge network
- **Observable**: Real-time logging and metrics collection enabled
- **Scalable**: Architecture supports multiple concurrent agents
- **Mobile Ready**: WebSocket endpoints prepared for React Native integration
