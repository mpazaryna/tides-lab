# Battle Test Guide

Create a manual testing guide for the React Native app. The emulator should already be running.

## Requirements

- No automated tests (Jest, etc.) - manual user testing only
- Step-by-step user interactions to verify functionality
- Observable actions that confirm features work
- Click-through guide for core app functionality

## Task

Tell me as a user how to test the app by walking through it manually.
