Perfect! That's a clean solution. You have:

  tides (old fork) → Leave it there as historical archive
  tides-lab (new clean repo) → Your active MCP learning platform

  Quick Summary of Where You Are:

  Local directory: /Users/mpaz/workspace/tides
  Remote: https://github.com/mpazaryna/tides-lab
  Branch: main
  Status: Clean, no mobile code, ready to work!

  What You Have Now:

  ✅ Clean MCP learning platform
  ✅ No fork relationship
  ✅ apps/server/ - MCP server (8 tools)
  ✅ apps/agent/ - AI coordinator (212 tests)
  ✅ apps/web/ - Next.js frontend
  ✅ AGENT_CODE_REVIEW.md - Full analysis

  Ready to Use:

  # Test it works
  npm run test:agent  # Should pass 212 tests

  The old tides repo will just sit there on GitHub as a backup/archive. Your active work is now in the clean tides-lab repo. Perfect setup for your new MCP
  project! 🚀
